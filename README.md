# Payment-Application


Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.

There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.

This application is made for SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account.
